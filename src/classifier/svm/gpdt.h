 ***        GPDT - Gradient Projection Decomposition Technique              ***
 ******************************************************************************
 ***                                                                        ***
 *** GPDT is a C++ software designed to train large-scale Support Vector    ***
 *** Machines for binary classification in both scalar and distributed      ***
 *** memory parallel environments. It uses the Joachims' problem            ***
 *** decomposition technique to split the whole quadratic programming (QP)  ***
 *** problem into a sequence of smaller QP subproblems, each one being      ***
 *** solved by a suitable gradient projection method (GPM). The presently   ***
 *** implemented GPMs are the Generalized Variable Projection Method        ***
 *** GVPM (T. Serafini, G. Zanghirati, L. Zanni, "Gradient Projection       ***
 *** Methods for Quadratic Programs and Applications in Training Support    ***
 *** Vector Machines"; Optim. Meth. Soft. 20, 2005, 353-378) and the        ***
 *** Dai-Fletcher Method DFGPM (Y. Dai and R. Fletcher,"New Algorithms for  ***
 *** Singly Linear Constrained Quadratic Programs Subject to Lower and      ***
 *** Upper Bounds"; Math. Prog. to appear).                                 ***
