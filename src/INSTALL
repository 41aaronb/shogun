GENERAL

On most platforms (Linux,MacOSX) it is sufficient to issue

./configure --enable-<interface>
make

where <interface> is one of the following R, matlab, python, octave.
See ./configure --help for additional options.

SPECIAL FEATURES

To enable Multiple Kernel Learning CPLEX(tm) is needed and one needs
to issue configure with ./configure --enable-<interface> --enable-cplex

PROBLEMS

In case header files or libraries are not at standard locations one needs
to manually adjust the .config file (copy .config to .config-local and modify
		that version).
