GENERAL

On most platforms (Linux,MacOSX,cygwin) it is sufficient to issue

./configure --enable-<interface>
make

where <interface> is one of the following R, matlab, python, octave.
Just running ./configure will compile a stand-a-lone version.

See ./configure --help for additional options.


SPECIAL FEATURES

To enable Multiple Kernel Learning CPLEX(tm) is needed and one needs
to issue configure with ./configure --enable-<interface> --enable-cplex


REQUIREMENTS

To compile the R interface you need to have the R developer files 
(debian package r-base-dev) installed.

To compile the octave interface you need to have the octave developer files 
(debian package octave2.1-headers or octave2.9-headers) installed.

To compile the python interface you need to have numarray 
(debian package python-numarray and python-numarray-ext) installed.

Also you will need atlas and lapack (debian lapack3-dev, 
atlas3-headers atlas3-base-dev or atlas3-altivec-dev atlas3-sse2-dev)
installed. In case atlas/lapack is unavailable use --disable-lapack
to nevertheless compile a slightly slower version.


PROBLEMS

In case header files or libraries are not at standard locations one needs
to manually adjust the .config file (copy .config to .config-local and modify
		that version).

The current gcc/g++ version in cygwin is broken. Please downgrade to 
gcc/g++ 3.x.x to get a working octave interface.
