TOP TEN+ ANNOYANCES
* generate config.h in lib/config.h + make make-system use HAVE_XXX
* CIO::message() mixed with printf's and matlabs mx* stuff -> we only need CIO::... ala gstreamer
  also there should be a global setting for verbosity and thus a differentiation into CIO::debug CIO::info CIO::warn CIO::critical etc
* remove or fix all the unused hacky stuff (svm_mpi/grad_descent...)
* create generic Distribution class which combines all density related stuff HMM/gaussians/linear hmm ... this would
  allow for using PluginEstimate with *any* distribution and clean all the hmm_test hacks
* create a one class classifier to avoid hacky one_class_hmm_test
* put things (== estimator/svm/hmm/features/kernel...) in some kind of list to be able to use/select them/many
  for certain purposes
* create generic Classifier class which combines i.e. KNN/Perceptron/SVM/PluginEstimate
* make unified testing possible, e.g. set_classifier XXX ; calc_output ; get_results etc.
* no standardized File IO (there needs to be some header parsing stuff/ little/big endian conversion...)
  atm, lots of things just use fopen/read/close...
* fix linear HMM to be equiv. with MMs
* all outputs are labels
* tcp/ip io fixen
* testsuite
* fix+test combined kernels
