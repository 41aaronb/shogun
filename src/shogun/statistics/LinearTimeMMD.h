/** @brief This class implements the linear time Maximum Mean Statistic as
 * described in [1] for streaming data by keeping the blocksize small and
 * fixed (see CStreamingMMD for background description).
 *
 * In particular, Given two sets of samples \f$\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{n_x}\sim p\f$ and
 * \f$\{y_i\}_{i=1}^{n_y}\sim q\f$ with block-size \f$B\f$ kept fixed, the
 * unbiased estimate of the test statistic under \f$\mathbf{H}_0\f$ follows the
 * following asymptotic behavior
 * \f[
 *	\sqrt{\frac{n_xn_y}{n_x+n_y}}\hat{\eta}_k\rightarrow\mathcal{N}\left(0,
 *	\frac{(B-1)(B-2)}{B(B_x-1)(B_y-1)}\sigma_{k,0}^2\right)
 * \f]
 * as \f$n\rightarrow\infty\f$.
 *
 * This class just defines the statistic multiplier \f$\zeta\f$ and \f$\gamma\f$
 * as \f$\sqrt{\frac{n_xn_y}{n_x+n_y}}\f$ and \f$\frac{B_xB_y(B_x-1)(B_y-1)}
 * {(B-1)(B-2)}\f$ respectively. It also computes the multiplier for Gaussian
 * approximation as well (see above).
 *
 * When INCOMPLETE statistic is used for \f$n_x=n_y\f$, the asymptotic
 * distribution becomes
 * \f[
 *	\sqrt{\frac{n}{4}}\hat{\eta}_k\rightarrow\mathcal{N}\left(0,\frac{4}{B-2}
 *	\sigma_{k,0}^2\right)
 * \f]
 * and then \f$\gamma\f$ becomes \f$\frac{B(B-2)}{16}\f$.
