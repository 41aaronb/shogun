/** @brief This class implements the block-based Maximum Mean Statistic as
 * described in [1] for streaming data (see CStreamingMMD for background
 * description).
 *
 * In particular, Given two sets of samples \f$\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{n_x}\sim p\f$ and
 * \f$\{y_i\}_{i=1}^{n_y}\sim q\f$ with block-size \f$B\f$ kept fixed, the
 * unbiased estimate of the test statistic under \f$\mathbf{H}_0\f$ follows the
 * following asymptotic behavior
 * \f[
 *	\frac{n_xn_y}{n_x+n_y}\sqrt{\frac{B}{n}}\hat{\eta}_k\rightarrow
 *	\mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma_{k,0}^2\right)
 * \f]
 * as \f$n\rightarrow\infty\f$.
 *
 * This class just defines the statistic multiplier \f$\zeta\f$ and \f$\gamma\f$
 * as \f$\frac{n_xn_y}{n_x+n_y}\sqrt{\frac{B}{n}}\f$ and \f$\left(\frac{B_xB_y}
 * {B_x+B_y} \right )^2\f$ respectively. The multiplier for Gaussian
 * approximation in this case is just 1 (see CLinearTimeMMD)
