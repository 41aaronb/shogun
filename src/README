- versioning scheme

an automagic version will be created from the date of the last cvs update.
if that is not enough...

use cvs-tags to create time-snapshots of genefinder like:
	cvs tag -c genefinder_0_1_0

in case one needs to branch genefinder use 
	cvs tag -b genefinder_0_1

branches should always be named like genefinder_0_1 or genefinder_1_2 etc
while tags should have the branch name as base, i.e. genefinder_0_1<prefix>
while prefix should usually be _0 ... _9 or _1_schering_final etc.

- types (use only these!):
	CHAR	(char)
	BYTE	(unsigned char)
	WORD	(unsigned short)
	UINT	(unsinged int)
	INT		(int)
	LONG	(long)
	REAL	(double)
	LONGREAL (long double)

	exceptions: file IO / matlab interface

naming conventions:
	-objects which can deal with features of type REAL and class SIMPLE don't need to contain Real/Simple in class name
	-others are required to clearify class/type they can handle, e.g. CSparseByteLinearKernel, CSparseGaussianKernel

- features
	-featureclass Simple/Sparse
		-featuretype Real/Byte/...
- preprocessors
	-featureclass Simple/Sparse
		-featuretype Real/Byte/...
- kernel
	-featureclass Simple/Sparse
		-featuretype Real/Byte/...
			-kerneltype Linear/Gaussian/...
