- types (use only these!):
	CHAR	(char)
	BYTE	(unsigned char)
	WORD	(unsigned short)
	UINT	(unsinged int)
	INT		(int)
	LONG	(long)
	REAL	(double)
	LONGREAL (long double)

	exceptions: file IO / matlab interface

naming conventions:
	-objects which can deal with features of type REAL and class SIMPLE don't need to contain Real/Simple in class name
	-others are required to clearify class/type they can handle, e.g. CSparseByteLinearKernel, CSparseGaussianKernel

- features

- preprocessors

- kernel
