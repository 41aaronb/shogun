naming conventions:
	-objects which can deal with features of type REAL and class SIMPLE don't need to contain Real/Simple in class name
	-others are required to clearify class/type they can handle, e.g. CSparseByteLinearKernel, CSparseGaussianKernel

- features
	-featureclass Simple/Sparse
		-featuretype Real/Byte/...
- preprocessors
	-featureclass Simple/Sparse
		-featuretype Real/Byte/...
- kernel
	-featureclass Simple/Sparse
		-featuretype Real/Byte/...
			-kerneltype Linear/Gaussian/...
