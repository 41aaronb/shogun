  There is currently no step by step user documentation. However for each of the interfaces
  a large number of examples is available which can be found in the \b interface / examples directory.
  For example python/examples python-modular/examples etc.

  Note that we always keep the python-modular examples complete and up-to-date
  and also perform regression tests using a test-suite.
