R Interface
----------------

To fire up SHOGUN in R make sure that you have SHOGUN correctly installed in
R. You can check this by typing ( let ">" be the R prompt )::

   > library()

inside of R, this command should list all R packages that have been
installed on your system.
You should have an entry like::

   sg                      The shogun package provides Hidden markov model
                           and Support Vector Machine algorithms for gene
                           finding and other tasks.

After you made sure that SHOGUN is installed correctly you can start it via::

   > library("sg")

you will see some informations of the SHOGUN core.
After this command R and SHOGUN are ready to receive your commands.

In general all commands in SHOGUN are issued using the function sg(...).
To invoke the SHOGUN command help one types::

   > sg("send_command","help")

and then a help text appears giving a short description of all commands.
