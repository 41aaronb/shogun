==========

SHOGUN comes as a stand-a-lone program accepting input via command-line or
from a *script* file, where standard file IO is used to read in /write out
data (optionally even tcp/ip). More importantly, it interfaces to
established matrix and statistics packages, such as Matlab(tm), Octave, R
and Python.
