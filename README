|    interface     |     status                                                |
+==================+===========================================================+
|matlab_and_octave | mature (no known problems)                                |
|python            | mature (no known problems)                                |

|libshogunui       | mature (no known problems, only required for static       |
|                  | interfaces)                                               |
|cmdline           | beta quality (some data types incomplete)                 |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|python-modular    | mature (no known problems)                                |
|octave-modular    | mature (no known problems)                                |
|r-modular         | pre-alpha quality (swig does not properly handle reference|
|                  | counting and thus we see crashes or leaked memory)        |
