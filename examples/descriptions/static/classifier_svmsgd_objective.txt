In this example a two-class linear support vector machine classifier is trained
on randomly generated data. As training algorithm the Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD) solver is used with the SVM regularization parameter C=10 and the
bias term in the classification rule switched off. After training the found
classifier is used to predict labels of test examples and the primal SVM
objective function is computed.
