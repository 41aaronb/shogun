In this example a two-class support vector machine classifier is trained on a
DNA splice-site detection data set and the trained classifier is then used to
predict labels on test set. As training algorithm SVM^light is used with SVM
regularization parameter C=1.2 and the Weighted Degree kernel. The unbiased
classification rule is used.
