In this example a one-class support vector machine classifier is trained on a
toy data set. The training algorithm finds a hyperplane in the RKHS which
separates the training data from the origin. The one-class classifier is
typically used to estimate the support of a high-dimesnional distribution.

  distribution. Neural Computation, 13, 2001, 1443-1471. 

As training algorithm LIBSVM is used with SVM regularization parameter C=1.2 and a
Gaussian kernel of width 2.1 and 10MB of kernel cache.
