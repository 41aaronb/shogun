In this example a multi-class support vector machine classifier is trained on a
toy data set and the trained classifier is then used to predict labels of test
examples. As training algorithm LIBSVM is used with SVM regularization
parameter C=1.2 and a Gaussian kernel of width 2.1 and 10MB of kernel cache.
The unbiased classification rule is used.
