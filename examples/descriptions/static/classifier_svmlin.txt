In this example a two-class linear support vector machine classifier is trained
on a toy data set and the trained classifier is then used to predict labels of
test examples. As training algorithm the SVMLIN solver is used with the SVM 
regularization parameter C=1.2. The solver iterates until it either finds
the epsilon-precise solution (epsilon=1e-5) or the maximal training time
max_train_time=60 is exceeded. The unbiased linear rule is trained.
