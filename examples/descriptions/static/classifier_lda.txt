In this example the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to train a two
class classifier on a toy 2-dimensional examples. The trained LDA classifier is
then used to predict test examples. The LDA linear classifier rule is optimal
under the assumption that both classes are Gaussian distributed with equal
co-variance. For more details on the LDA see e.g.
